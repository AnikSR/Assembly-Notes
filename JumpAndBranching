#Jump Operators:
================

#JNZ:
-----
	Jump if not zero. Examines the Zero Flag. If ZF is set, no jump is made and program continues. If ZF is not set, then jump condition
	is fulfilled and program jump to lebel.
	syntax:
		lebel: statement(s)
			.
			.
			.
		jnz lebel
	example:
	1	mov eax, 5
	2	DoMore: dec eax
	3	jnz DoMore	; Program will keep jumping back to line 2 and decrement eax until its 0.
				; This is equivalent to: while(var!=0) var--;

#JMP:
-----
	JMP is the unconditional jump command. This is the underlying CPU command of "goto" and just like "goto" its a one way ticket to hell.
	syntax:	Similar to conditional jump statements.
		lebel: statement(s)
			.
			.
			.
		jmp lebel
