Bitwise logical ops:
--------------------
AND, OR, XOR, NOT


Shift and rotate instructions:
------------------------------
SHR, ROR, RCR, SHL, ROL, RCL


Bit testing:
------------
TEST, BT

# TEST

Syntax:
-------
	test <dest>, <bit mask>

Description:
------------
TEST performs a AND operation between the <dest> and <bit mask> operands, then sets the flags as AND would have done and then discards the
resutl, so <dest> operatnd remains unaffected.


# BT - Bit Test

Syntax:
-------
	bt <value containing bit>, <bit number>

Description:
------------
BT tests the bit specified by <bit number> in <value containing bit> and sets CF accordingly. For example:

	bt rax, 32	; Checks the bit 32 and carries the value to CF. If bit32 is on then sets CF, if its off then turns CF off.

BT can take memory and direct value as its first argument as well.


# BTS and BTR - Bit Test and Set/Remove.

Syntax:
-------
	bts	<value containing bit>, <bit number>
	btr <value containing bit>, <bit number>

Description:
------------
	BTS and BTR works the same as BT. But in addition of testing, BTS sets the target bit to 1 and BTR to 0. Note: BTS or BTR  first transfer
the current value of the trget bit to CF, then sets or clears the bit. The set/clear operation has no bearing on their test result.
current value of the target bit to CF
